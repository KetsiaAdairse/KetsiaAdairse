- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm passionate about Astrophysics, reading science fiction and fantasy, but a novel also has a place in my heart.
- Technology is transforming my perception of “the world”. I love reading and listening to music at the same time,
- but if I'm doing something and you want to ask or comment on a subject, I won't be able to pay attention to you, because I can't do two things at the same time,
- when one of them demands more of my attention than than the other. My favorite series are Supernatural and Harry Potter. I love anime and my favorite is Narutinho!
